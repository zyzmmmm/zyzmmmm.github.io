    <h1>Image Stitching Project</h1>
    <h2>Name: Your Name</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Shoot the Pictures</h2>
        <p>To begin your project, it’s essential to capture multiple photographs with a focus on keeping the center of projection fixed. This often involves rotating your camera while taking the pictures to maintain perspective. Avoid using fisheye or lenses with significant barrel distortion, as they can warp straight lines. Instead, opt for a wide-angle lens to create more engaging mosaics.</p>
        <p>When taking the pictures, aim to shoot them closely in time to minimize changes in lighting and subject movement. Ensure there is a significant overlap—ideally between 40% and 70%—between adjacent images to facilitate easier stitching. It is also acceptable to adjust the zoom between shots, and consider capturing scenes that contain rich details for better results.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Recover Homographies</h2>
        <p>Once the images are captured, the next step is to compute the homography, which defines the transformation between pairs of images. This is done using corresponding points from the two images, where you need to write a function, <code>computeH(im1_pts, im2_pts)</code>, that calculates the 3x3 homography matrix. To achieve a stable and accurate transformation, it’s crucial to gather more than four corresponding points, allowing you to form an overdetermined system of equations, which can then be solved using least squares.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Warp the Images</h2>
        <p>With the homography matrix calculated, you can proceed to warp the images. Create a function called <code>warpImage(im, H)</code> that applies this matrix to warp each image into alignment with the reference image. You can choose to utilize either forward or inverse warping methods, but keep in mind the need to prevent aliasing during the resampling process. It's beneficial to employ techniques like <code>scipy.interpolate.griddata</code> to handle this efficiently, focusing on vectorized implementations without explicit loops.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Image Rectification</h2>
        <p>After validating the warping process, the next task is image rectification. This involves taking a photograph of a known rectangular object—like a painting or a poster—and computing the homography that transforms it into a perfectly rectangular shape. This step is crucial for testing and ensuring that your homography and warping methods are functioning correctly. For example, you can select the corners of a tile in the image to create the required correspondences.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Create a Mosaic Image</h2>
        <p>Now that the images are aligned, the next step is to create a mosaic. You can either warp all images into a new projection or gradually add them one by one. If you decide to use a single warp for all images, calculate the final mosaic size beforehand. Then, blend the images using techniques like weighted averaging or Laplacian pyramid blending to produce a seamless composite image. This helps to minimize any artifacts that arise from direct image overlaps.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Submit Your Results</h2>
        <p>Finally, compile all your code and prepare for submission. Ensure that you include a comprehensive README file that describes the purpose and functionality of each function. This will help others understand your work and the steps you took in completing the project. Make sure to showcase your final results through this documentation.</p>

        <h2>7. Bells & Whistles</h2>
        <p>To enhance your project, consider exploring additional techniques such as spherical or cylindrical mappings. These methods can be particularly useful for wide mosaics, as they offer a more appropriate representation than planar projections. Furthermore, you might experiment with creating a 360-degree cylindrical panorama by stitching images together while using translation only. Lastly, consider working with video data to generate dynamic mosaics.</p>
