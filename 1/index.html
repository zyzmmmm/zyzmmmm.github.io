    <p>Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii (1863-1944) was a Russian photographer and chemist renowned for 
        his pioneering work in early color photography. He record three exposures of every scene onto a glass 
        plate using a red, a green, and a blue filter. His extensive collection of photographs, preserved and 
        digitized by institutions like the Library of Congress, provides a unique and valuable historical record 
        of that era.</p>

    <p>This project will put his theory into practice by synthesizing the original image through the red, green, 
        and blue channels of the image. On the basis of exhaustive search, I used the search method of image pyramid and the technique of automatic 
        white balance to achieve faster search speed and higher image quality.</p>
