    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii (1863-1944) was a Russian photographer and chemist renowned for 
        his pioneering work in early color photography. He record three exposures of every scene onto a glass 
        plate using a red, a green, and a blue filter. His extensive collection of photographs, preserved and 
        digitized by institutions like the Library of Congress, provides a unique and valuable historical record 
        of that era.</p>

    <p>This project will put his theory into practice by synthesizing the original image through the red, green, 
        and blue channels of the image. On the basis of exhaustive search, I used the search method of image 
        pyramid and the technique of automatic white balance and edge detection to achieve faster search speed 
        and higher image quality.</p>

    <h2>Image Synthesis</h2>
    <p>At first, I assumed that the pixel offset was between -15 and 15, and found the best match between the red, 
        green, and blue channels in this range. I used both MSE and NCC methods to calculate the matching score. 
        Although both have good results, I believe NCC can match images more reasonably than MSE, because some 
        images have pixels that are not similar in the three channels. For example, in emir.tif, the pixel value 
        of clothes in the blue channel is larger, while the pixel value of clothes in the red channel is smaller. 
        If you want to match the two, using MSE cannot well represent the degree of image matching because their 
        pixel differences are significant. However, using NCC for absolute value calculation will not have such 
        concerns. In the subsequent improvement work, I used NCC as my scoring function.</p>
