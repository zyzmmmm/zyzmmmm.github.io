    <h3>Part 1.1: Finite Difference Operator</h3>
    <p>In this task, I use Finite Difference Operator to convolve the image, calculate the gradient size 
        of each pixel, and finally use a threshold to determine whether a pixel is an edge. If the threshold 
        is large, not all edges can be represented; If the threshold is small, unwanted things may appear. 
        After my adjustments, the output image is as follows:</p>

    <h3>Part 1.2: Derivative of Gaussian (DoG) Filter</h3>

    <p>I used cv2.getGaussianKernel() to obtain a 1D Gaussian kernel and then calculated the outer product of 
        this kernel with its transpose to get a 2D Gaussian kernel. First, I convolved the image with this kernel 
        to produce a blurred image. Then, I applied the Finite Difference Operator mentioned in the previous 
        question to detect edges, followed by thresholding for binarization. If I use the same threshold as in 
        the previous question, not all edges can be detected because the image was blurred; however, when I lowered 
        the threshold, the edge detection improved, and the resulting image became clearer and more continuous.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Due to the associative property of convolution, convolving the 2D Gaussian kernel with the Finite Difference 
        Operator first and then applying the resulting convolution kernel to the image will produce the same result.</p>

    <h3>Part 2.1: Image "Sharpening"</h3>
    <p>The image has three RGB channels. For a single-channel image, using the Gaussian filter created earlier and 
        combining them, I obtained a low-frequency blurred image. Then, by using an impulse filter to subtract the 
        Gaussian filter result, I obtained a high-frequency edge image. To sharpen the original image, we simply add 
        the high-frequency image to the original image, making the edge details of the original image clearer. 
        Additionally, we can combine the original image at a ratio of 1 with the high-frequency image at a ratio of 
        n. By adjusting the value of n, we can achieve varying degrees of sharpening (when n = 0, it returns to the 
        original image).</p>

        </div>
    </div>
    
    <p>In fact, we can represent the process of "impulse filter minus the Gaussian filter" using a single filter, as 
        shown in the diagram below. When the sharpened image is blurred and then sharpened again, the overall image 
        still becomes blurry, but many prominent lines appear. This is the result of sharpening the image twice, 
        indicating that sharpening cannot be used for restoring blurry images.</p>

    <h3>Part 2.2: Hybrid Images</h3>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
        
    <p>The principle of creating Hybrid Images is to combine the low frequencies of one image with the high frequencies 
        of another, producing an image that appears differently when viewed up close or from a distance. By using a 
        Gaussian filter to extract the low-frequency features of the human portrait and using the method from Part 2.1 
        to extract the high-frequency features of the cat image, averaging the two images results in a Hybrid Image of 
        both. We can also adjust the ratio of the two, as in Part 2.2, to determine which features—human or cat—are more 
        prominent. Of course, before doing this, the two images must be aligned and scaled to the same size for a better 
        effect. Similar to Part 2.2, perform the same operations on each channel and then combine them at the end.</p>

    <h3>Part 2.3: Gaussian and Laplacian Stacks</h3>
    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>The Gaussian stack refers to repeatedly convolving an image with a Gaussian filter to obtain a series of increasingly 
        blurred images. The Laplacian stack can be derived by subtracting adjacent images in the Gaussian stack, with the 
        last layer being the same as the last layer of the Gaussian stack. Applying the Gaussian and Laplacian stacks to the 
        apple and orange images results in very blurred images in the final layer. In the middle layers of the Laplacian stack, 
        I obtained edge features ranging from detailed to coarse. After normalizing the edge features and combining the two 
        using an impulse function, the following output was achieved.</p>

    <h3>Part 2.4: Multiresolution Blending</h3>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>First, I tried to blend the two images from left to right. I applied the Laplacian pyramid to both images and used a 
        vertical boundary 01 mask to create a Gaussian pyramid with the same number of layers as the images. In each layer, 
        the two images were combined by weighted addition using the coefficients from the mask, resulting in a blended image 
        for each layer. By summing the images from all layers, I obtained the final blended image.</p>

    <p>If you want to blend images in other ways, you only need to change the form of the mask, for example:</p>
